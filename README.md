# termlink
*THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT BRANCH. It's specifically reserved for source code that either doesn't compile or doesn't run correctly (eg segfault). I will merge with main whenever that doesn't happen.*

A recreation of the terminal hacking minigame from the Fallout series, with a sizable portion of personal touches.

This serves a few purposes:

* Learning how to actually use git beyond cloning repos (ignore my first few commits being just bad)
* Actually learning C++ (ignore the whole thing just being generally bad)
* Because I have an actual vintage terminal from the late 70's, an SWTPC CT-82 Terminal, and I wanted to see this sorta thing on it.
