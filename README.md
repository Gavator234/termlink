# termlink
*(This is under construction! As of* ***6/3/23*** *it doesn't even contain anything more than a cool intro)*

A recreation of the terminal hacking minigame from the Fallout series, with a sizable portion of personal touches.

This serves a few purposes:

* Learning how to actually use git beyond cloning repos (ignore my first few commits being just bad)
* Actually learning C++ (ignore the whole thing just being generally bad)
* Because I have an actual vintage terminal from the late 70's, an SWTPC CT-82 Terminal, and I wanted to see this sorta thing on it.
